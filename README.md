# 🦷 Google Sheets: Dental Clinic Performance Analysis & 5th Quarter Strategy

## Project Overview

This project delivers an in-depth **Business Intelligence (BI) analysis** and strategic proposal for a newly established dental clinic operating in a competitive market. The primary objective was to calculate and analyze the clinic's operational parameters over a **15-month period** (four quarters) to provide accurate forecasts and a solid strategy for maximizing profitability in the **5th Quarter**.

### Key Deliverables

* **Financial & Operational Modeling:** Rebuilding and verifying core calculations (KPIs, revenue, costs) using advanced Google Sheets formulas.
* **Data Visualization:** Developing custom charts and graphs (beyond basic metrics) to visualize performance trends and facilitate deep analysis.
* **Strategic Forecasting (Optional but performed):** Providing a forecast for Q5 based on an effective strategy, considering factors like pricing, marketing budget, and doctor composition.

## 📈 Methodology and Analysis Focus

The project was executed by formulating and testing data-driven hypotheses related to clinic performance, customer behavior, and marketing effectiveness. The analysis successfully moved beyond basic reporting to answer critical business questions:

| Category | Hypotheses Investigated |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Client Behavior** | Defining the typical client profile (age, frequency). Analyzing customer retention after initial visits (especially those acquired via discounts). |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Analyzing doctor performance (revenue, material costs, client feedback, churn rate). Determining the clinic's **Break-Even Point (BEP)**. |
| **Marketing Effectiveness** | Calculating Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). Comparing the efficiency of referral programs vs. general advertising in correlation with **NPS** (Net Promoter Score). |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Investigating the dependency of daily revenue on discount levels. Analyzing the return rate of customers attracted by first-visit discounts. |

## 📊 Project Visuals & Tools

The core of this project is a comprehensive Google Sheets workbook featuring interactive reports, forecasts, and visual dashboards.


**Tools Used:**

* **Google Sheets:** Data modeling, complex array formulas, calculation engine.
* **Data Visualization:** Custom charting to illustrate profitability trends (e.g., Waterfall chart for profit/loss prognosis) and comparative doctor performance.

## Strategy Summary (5th Quarter Proposal)

The analysis concluded that despite recent small profits, the clinic's overall financial balance remains negative. The proposed 5th Quarter Strategy, derived from modeling and testing various scenarios, focuses on optimizing the doctor roster and setting service costs relative to the market to achieve sustained profitability without relying on extensive discount programs.
